WebRoutes is the first piece of a larger project aimed at demystifying the web by illustrating what happens in the brief moment between when you type a URL in your browserâ€™s address bar and that web page appears on your screen. To "visit" a website is to request a copy of that website's source code files to be broken up into smaller packets and sent from a server (located somewhere in the world) to your browser where it is reconstructed and rendered. The routes these packets take are rarely a straight line from a server to your browser, and tracing these routes reveals a set of interests and influences based on the Internet's peculiar geopolitical situation.
